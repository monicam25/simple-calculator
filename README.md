# About my simple calculator project
This is a short project for a simple calculator, written in C++. 
This code is structured to continuously gather user input for a menu choice of mathematical operations until the quit menu choice is entered. This calculator program supports both decimal and whole number user inputs for varibles to calculate.
It is also structured to continuously loop and ask for an input for a valid menu choice if an invalid integer is given as a menu choice.
